overview_hero_50004<>When a queen was pregnant, she wished that her son would be as brave as an eagle and as strong as a lion. The gods heard her wish and granted it. So the boy Grimm was born, instead of a handsome young prince, he was a monster with half an eagle and half a lion.\nThe King was so disappointed that he removed him from the list of heirs to the throne. Grimm grew up in estrangement by his father. Shame on himself, he ran away from home.\nOne day, their kingdom was defeated by the army of darkness. The enemies executed the king by dropping him from the high wall. Fortunately, Grimm suddenly appeared and caught his father in the air. He had been flying across the lands and asked for reinforcements from other kingdoms. Thanks to that, the army of darkness was defeated and had to withdraw.\nAlthough still not inheriting the throne, Grimm was loved by everyone. He soars high into the sky, and under his wings every innocent being is protected.

overview_hero_20008<>Moblin is a tiny man who yearns to demonstrate the power of the Goblins. On a journey to find strength, Goblin meets a lost elephant and two lonely lives have become soul mates. Moblin named the elephant Fanto.\nGod does not disappoint people, going through a journey full of hardships and challenges, Moblin has gained strength from training and a contract with the Fire God. But as they say, don't play with fire, the Fire God treacherously put in the contract a counter-curse. Because he originally did not favor the Goblins, even considering the Goblins as an inferior race.\nCursed, Moblin suffered physical and emotional pain. Fanto has no power, can't help Moblin, can only spend day by day with his soul mate. The curse lasted for decades, which is also the many years Moblin and Fanto fought with. Fanto went to the god of fire and volunteered to take the curse on him to save Moblin. The Fire God approved, and Fanto took on an evil form like a prehistoric mammoth. But Fanto's humanity remained because Moblin's sincere friendship saved Fanto's soul from corruption. In the end, the two friends were still together, continuing to travel to new lands.

overview_hero_60004<>Karos sits silently at the middle of the temple. \nIn fact, he could not remember the last time he felt this utmost silence around himself. Karos was chosen to be an Ancient God's priest since the day human first aware of the God's existence. He helped deliver his Master's message, prophecy and fearful words of warning. He indulged in a feeling of power whenever he saw the humans kneeling after hearing the oracle dropped from his lip, seeing them quivering in fear made him even more hungry for power. Maybe, he had become too greedy. In order to retain the sensation, he spread false prophecy about plagues, wars and disasters without Ancient God's instruction, turning the world upside down by his own embroided nightmare.\nWhen he discovered what Karos was doing behind his back, Ancient God decided to take away Karos' gift as a priest, he cound no longer hear the God's voice. As for the human, betrayed by their belief at Karos, they deserted the temple and it's priest, let it crumble to the Land of the Forgotten.\nNo. I cannot let myself become forgotten!\nWith that determination in mind, Karos put on the mask of her old Master and the scepter of Dark magic, he sets out on a journey to instill nightmares of pain, and indignation and death on humanity, just like the God he once served
